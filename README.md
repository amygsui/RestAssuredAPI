## How to Write Test Cases

## How to Run Tests
All test triggering is done through Maven commands. This framework supports multiple different
types of test executions such as: smoke, regression, and end-to-end tests on different environments
such as QA, Staging, and UAT.
### Executing Specific Tests
If you would like to execute a specific test stated in the testng.xml file:
```shell script
mvn test -Dtestof="smoke_api"
```
If you would like to execute all tests stated in the testng.xml file:
```shell script
mvn test
```
If you would like to execute multiple different types of tests stated in the testng.xml file:
```shell script
mvn test -Dtestof="test1" -Denv="Staging"
